  "headline": "It Takes Two wins Game of the Year gong at 2021 Game Awards, trailers released for Star Wars Eclipse, Sonic, Elden Ring and Alan Wake 2",
  "body": "  It Takes Two, a co-op adventure about a couple fixing their broken marriage, has won the Game of the Year gong at the 2021 Game Awards.   It also took home the awards for Best Family Game and Best Multiplayer Game, having been nominated in six categories.    Developed by Hazelight Studios, It Takes Two follows the story of May and Cody, who are going through a divorce.    When their daughter unknowingly transports their minds into two dolls, they must reconnect to find their way back to their bodies.    It Takes Two, available on PC, PlayStation and Xbox, beat Nintendo's Metroid Dread, Resident Evil Village, Psychonauts 2, Deathloop and Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart to take out the top gong.    Youtube It Takes Two trailer    The Game of the Year Award has previously gone to The Last of Us Part II (2020), Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice (2019), God of War (2018) and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017).    The Game Awards have become the \"Oscars of gaming\" — although far more people tune in.    Last year, the Game Awards drew about 83 million viewers, whereas this year's Academy Awards had its smallest ever rating of just 9.8 million.    Part of the reason the Game Awards attract so many viewers is because the show features big announcements and reveals from producers who want to show off their next big thing.    Here are a few of the big ones from this year.    Star Wars Eclipse    In a galaxy far, far away … so far that it hasn't even got a release date yet, there is a new Star Wars game.    French video game developer Quantic Dream today dropped the first trailer for Star Wars: Eclipse.    This latest adventure is set in the Outer Rim during the High Republic era and will feature all-new characters and environments.    Youtube Star Wars Eclipse trailer    Sonic gets a movie sequel and game    Speedy blue hedgehog Sonic is back with friends and a whole new world to explore.    First the movie: Ben Schwartz returns in the titular role for Sonic 2 alongside Jim Carrey as Dr Robotnik with an ever bigger moustache.    But this time viewers will finally get to see Tails, voiced by Colleen O'Shaughnessey, and Knuckles, voiced by Idris Elba.    The movie is due to be released in cinemas in April 2022, the same year as SEGA release Sonic Frontiers.    Frontiers will have an open-world similar to Breath of the Wild    Youtube Sonic Frontiers trailer    Alan Wake 2    The long-awaited sequel to the 2010 game Alan Wake is finally here — or at least the trailer is. The game won't be out until 2023.    Alan Wake 2 is going to be a survival horror rather than a straight action game.    The trailer gives little away, but we do know the game will be available on PC, PlayStation and Xbox.    Youtube Alan Wake 2 trailer    Nightingale    One of the game announcements to cause the biggest buzz is Nightingale, a debut by Canadian developer Inflexion Games.    It is described as \"a shared-world survival crafting experience set in a rich, gaslamp Victorian fantasy setting\", and Nightingale playtesting starts in 2022.    Youtube Nightingale trailer    Elden Ring    A new trailer teases a little bit more about the highly anticipated Elden Ring , which is slated for release on February 25 next year.    The game is a collaboration between infamous video game creator Hidetaka Miyazaki and Game of Thrones author George R R Martin.    The cinematic trailer reveals a bit more about the story and elements of Elden Ring.    Youtube Elden Ring trailer    Halo the series    Fans have had another glimpse of the live-action Master Chief, played by Pablo Schreiber, in a new trailer of the upcoming Halo TV series.    The show, due to be released in 2022 on paid streaming service Paramount+, has a big budget and Steven Spielberg as an executive producer behind it.    Set in the 26th-century, Halo follows the conflict between humanity and an alien threat known as the Covenant.    Youtube Halo the series trailer    Wonder Woman    Arguably the biggest surprise of the Game Awards was the revelation Wonder Woman was getting her own solo game.    Monolith Productions, best known for Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, said it would be a single-player, open-world, action game.    Set in the DC Universe, Diana of Themyscira will fight to unite her Amazon family and the humans from the modern world.    That's all we know folks. There's no date for a release.
